## Backend Development

### Overview

The backend is built using Python and FastAPI, providing a robust and high-performance server to handle ROS2 interactions, WebSocket communications, and API endpoints. It integrates directly with ROS2 to subscribe to relevant topics and serve data to the frontend in real-time.

### Architecture

The backend architecture follows a modular design, separating concerns between ROS2 communication, API handling, and real-time data streaming. The main components include:

1. **FastAPI Server**: Manages HTTP and WebSocket endpoints.
2. **ROS2 Interface**: Handles ROS2 node initialization, topic subscriptions, and data processing.
3. **WebSocket Handlers**: Facilitate real-time communication between the backend and frontend.
4. **External Program Integration**: Incorporates `ttyd` for a web-based terminal interface.

### Key Components

#### FastAPI Server (`backend/main.py`)

The FastAPI server serves as the core of the backend, handling HTTP requests and managing WebSocket connections. Key functionalities include:

- **CORS Middleware**: Configured to allow cross-origin requests, enabling the frontend to communicate with the backend seamlessly.

**Key Features:**

- **Asynchronous Handling**: Utilizes asynchronous functions to manage multiple WebSocket connections efficiently.
- **Threading**: Runs ROS2 spinning in a separate daemon thread to prevent blocking the main server thread.
- **Logging**: Configures logging for monitoring server activities and debugging.

#### ROS2 Interface (`backend/ros_interface.py`)

The ROS2 Interface is responsible for initializing the ROS2 node, subscribing to relevant topics, and processing incoming data. It acts as the bridge between ROS2 and the backend server.

**Key Features:**

- **Topic Subscriptions**: Automatically subscribes to essential ROS2 topics such as `/camera/color/image_raw` and `/map`.

- **Thread Safety**: Implements thread locks to ensure safe access to shared data structures.
- **Dynamic Topic Management**: Provides mechanisms to list available ROS2 topics and manage subscriptions dynamically.

#### WebSocket Handlers

WebSocket handlers are defined within the FastAPI server to facilitate real-time data transmission to the frontend. Each handler corresponds to a specific data stream:

- **`/ws/terminal`**: Streams terminal input and output, enabling direct command execution from the web interface.
- **`/ws/camera_feed`**: Streams real-time camera images encoded in Base64.
- **`/ws/topics`**: Provides a dynamic list of available ROS2 topics.

- **Debugging Efficiency**: Detailed logging facilitates quicker identification and resolution of problems, enhancing development productivity.

#### CORS Middleware

**Concept:**

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows or restricts resources to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated.

**Implementation:**

- **CORS Configuration**: Utilizes FastAPI's `CORSMiddleware` to allow all origins (`allow_origins=["*"]`), enabling the frontend to communicate with the backend seamlessly.
- **Security Considerations**: While enabling all origins is convenient for development, it may pose security risks in production environments.

**Learnings:**
